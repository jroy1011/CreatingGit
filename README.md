# CreatingGit
Initalizing Repo: 
- To initalize Repo just run the InitalizeRepo() method and only that method. When you run the InitlaizeRepo()
method it should run all the other methods: createGitFolder(), createObjectsFolder(), createIndexFile(), and 
createHeadFile()
   - the createGiFolder() makes a new directory called git
   - the createObjectsFolder() makes a new directory called objects inside the git folder which was created in the createGitFolder()
   - the createIndexFile() makes a new file called Index in the git folder
   - the createHeadFile() makes a new file called HEAD in the git folder
